# Welcome to OpenStreetMap and the Swiss OSM Community!

Because you are a new OSM contributor we would like to quickly point you to the available resources and activities in Switzerland and at the same time welcome you to our community.

Appropriate tagging, documentation and event announcements, for example the monthly “Stammtisch” in Zürich, can be found in the Swiss part of the OSM Wiki: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Switzerland

Further information can be found on the sites http://osm.ch/ and http://sosm.ch/, both operated by the Swiss OSM association.

And you can follow us on https://twitter.com/SwissOSM

If you have questions that you want to address to a larger group, we recommend posting them on the talk-ch mailing list. Events and other news will be announced there too. You can subscribe to the list on http://lists.openstreetmap.ch/

Please do not use third party sources, for example map.admin.ch, google and so on, without checking with the community first. Most such sources cannot be legally used for OSM even if they make the impression that they are offering open data.

Since March 2021 we are allowed to use aerial imagery from swisstopo, currently this is not available automatically in "iD" the online editor. Please see <https://sosm.ch/use-of-swisstopo-data-and-products-with-and-in-openstreetmap/> for details on how to configure this manually.

Happy mapping!

SOSM, Swiss OpenStreetMap Association

PS: if you are are looking for something to add to OpenStreetMap, your house number and those of your neighbors is a good start and easy to do.
